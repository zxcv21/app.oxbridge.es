</p><p class="s12">PRESENT CONTINUOUS VS PRESENT SIMPLE TENSE</p><p>In English, when we want to express HABITS (actions which happen regularly— every day, every week, etc.) or STATES (things which do not often change— opinions, conditions, etc.), we do it with the help of the verbs without any modification.</p><p class="s14">Note: remember that for HE, SHE or IT, we add an –s to the verb.</p><p>For questions, we start with DO and DON’T and DOES and DOESN’T if it refers to HE, SHE or IT. Then we place the subject and after it the verb without an –s and then the rest of the statement.<br/>For negative statements, after the subject we place DO and DON’T and DOES and DOESN’T if it refers to HE, SHE or IT. After that we place the verb without an –s.<br/>Here you have some clarifying examples:</p><p class="s13">HABIT:</p><p>1.

</p><p class="s12">ADVERBS: USE AND FORMATION. INTENSIFIERS IN COMPARISON</p><p><b>Students</b>: Adverbs modify verbs. They tell you <i>How </i>something is done.</p><p class="s13">Example: <i>How does he she sing? - She sings beautifully. </i>Rule: <span class="p">Adverbs are often formed by adding -ly to an adjective </span>Example: beautiful - beautifully, careful - carefully</p><p>Be Careful!<br/>Some adjectives don&#39;t change in the adverb form. The most important of these are: fast - fast, hard - hard<br/>“Good” is probably the most important exception. The adverb form of<br/>&#39;good&#39; is &#39;well&#39;. Unfortunately, this is a common mistake that many<br/>Americans make! NOT!!: He plays tennis good.</p><p class="s13">Rule: <span class="p">Adverbs can also modify an adjective. In this case, the adverb is placed before the adjective.</span></p><p class="s13">Example: She is extremely happy. They are absolutely sure.</p><p>Be Careful!<br/>Do not use &#39;very&#39; with adjectives that express an increased quality of a basic adjective <b>Example: </b><i>good - fantastic</i><br/>NOT!!: She is a very beautiful woman.</p><p class="s13">Rule: <span class="p">Adverbs of frequency (always, never, sometimes, often, etc.) usually come before the main verb</span></p><p class="s13">Example: He is often late for class. Do you always eat in a restaurant? They don&#39;t usually travel on Fridays.</p><p>Be Careful!<br/>Adverbs of frequency expressing infrequency are not usually used in the negative or question form. NOT!!: Does she rarely eat fish? They don&#39;t seldom go to the cinema.<br/>Adverbs of frequency are often placed at the beginning of a sentence.</p><p class="s13">Example: <i>Sometimes, he likes to go to museums.</i></p><p>Adverbs of frequency follow - come after - the verb &#39;to be&#39;. <b>Example: </b><i>He is sometimes late for work</i><br/>

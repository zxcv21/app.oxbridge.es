<p class="s13">COUNTABLE AND UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS</p><p>In  English,  the  correct  use  of  some  words  depends  on  whether  they  are countable or not. Depending on if we can or cannot count some things, we use one structure or another. This is especially important when we want to talk about <b>quantities.</b></p><p class="s14">COUNTABLE NOUNS</p><p><span><IMG width="109" height="128" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_009.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="120" height="128" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_010.jpg"/></span><br/>There are some nouns in English that we can count, that is, we can put a number before them in order to specify how many units there are. We use <b>A </b>with words beginning with a vowel (a bottle) and AN with words beginning with a consonant (An umbrella). They have a plural form. Eg:<br/><span><IMG width="128" height="68" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_011.jpg"/></span><br/>I have got <b>a </b>bottle.            I have got two bottles.       I have <b>some </b>bottles.<br/>I have <b>many </b>bottles.<br/>1) In plural, if we don’t specify the quantity, we use SOME for positive sentences.<br/>Eg. There are SOME chairs in the classroom.<br/><span><IMG width="332" height="213" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_012.gif"/></span><br/>2) We use ANY for questions and negatives. Eg: Are there any books on the table?<br/>There aren’t any apples in the fridge. There are NO apples in the fridge.<br/>

  </p><p class="s13">INDEFINITE PRONOUNS: SOMEONE, ANYBODY, EVERYTHING</p><p>It happens when we speak that if we don’t have some information or in order to avoid repetitions, we substitute one word (a name, a person, an object, etc.) by another, more <b>generic </b>one. For instance, if we say: “<b>My mother </b>is ill. <b>My mother </b>has flu”, we will be repeating the words “my mother”, and we can substitute this by saying “<b>She </b>has flu”.<br/>This is what a pronoun is.<br/>Or, if you are at home and there is <b>an unknown person </b>knocking at the door, you  can  say that  <b>someone </b>is  knocking at  the door. <b>Someone  </b>is  also a<br/>pronoun (although you do not need to know this).<br/>Now, let’s see how we can express ourselves by using this <b>generic </b>words instead of the particular ones.</p><p class="s14">SOMEONE/SOMEBODY <span class="p">(they substitute an unknown person)</span></p><p>Eg: (picture) Someone/Somebody is knocking at the door.

  </p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING PREFERENCES AND OPTIONS: “EITHER / OR, NEITHER / NOR”</p><p>In our daily lives, we often need to express preferences that have to do with <b>a choice</b>. That is, you can <b>prefer doing one thing instead of another, or the two at the same time, or none of them</b>. In these cases, you need to explain by means of easy formulas what your preferences are. Let’s see what expressions you can use:<br/>1)  When we have two options to choose, we use EITHER...OR and not<br/>OR...OR.<br/>In this cases, the two options are possible or acceptable according to the speaker.<br/>Eg. We can EITHER go to the cinema OR to the theatre. (both options are acceptable)<br/><span><IMG width="277" height="454" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_055.png"/></span><br/>He is EITHER Japanese OR Chinese.<br/>

NEITHER Tom NOR Jenny came to the cinema.

Remember that you can do this in many ways.</p><p class="s19">The most common one is to use SO for positive agreement and NEITHER or NOR for negative agreement and use the same verb in the same tense as in the main sentence.</p><p class="s19">One way that we can show similarities between ourselves and the people we talk to is like this:</p><p class="s20">A: I love Indian food.</p><p class="s20">B: Yeah, me too. / Yeah.

However, when we have negative verb forms (i.e. forms which contain <span class="s21">n&#39;t </span>or <span class="s21">never</span>), we need to use a different structure to share our feeling:</p><p class="s20">A: I don&#39;t like baseball.</p><p class="s20">B:  <span style=" color: #F00;">No, me neither / Neither do I / I don&#39;t either</span>.</p><p class="s22">Do you?

Thus, we express an action in progress in the past (yesterday, two weeks ago, last Friday, etc.)<br/>Eg. She <b>was playing </b>tennis <b>yesterday</b>.<br/>Actions like this usually need further explanation about the frame in time they happened, so we usually specify this time frame by using another past action that took place within the time the first action was developed:<br/>Eg: When I was having a shower, the telephone rang.<br/>

We do it with these structures below:</span></p><p>1) Past forms of the verbs are used to express finished actions in the past. They are often used with words expressing time such as YESTERDAY, LAST<br/>WEEK, 2 YEARS AGO, etc. All these expressions refer to the past. If it is a REGULAR verb, we add –ed.<br/>Last Saturday I <b>played </b>beach volleyball.<br/><span><IMG width="199" height="274" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_095.jpg"/></span><br/>If the verb is IRREGULAR, you need to learn the special irregular forms of the verbs.<br/>Yesterday I <b>went </b>to the cinema.<br/>We use DID + Verb in infinitive for NEGATIVE sentences.

(we stress the duration of the action)<br/><span><IMG width="230" height="240" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_099.gif"/></span><br/>For <b>negative sentences</b>, add NOT after “to be”: It <b>was not (wasn’t) raining</b><br/>yesterday”<br/>For <b>questions, </b>invert the order: “W<b>as it raining </b>yesterday?”<br/>When they are both in the same sentence, we use the past simple for the finished action and the past continuous for the action that it is not finished in the past and that interrupts or occurs at that moment in the past.<br/>When a friend WAS DRIVING me home, he CRASHED her car.</p><p class="s14">UNFINISHED ACTION                                     FINISHED ACTION</p><p><br/><span><IMG width="263" height="204" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_101.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s13">PAST CONTINUOUS VS SIMPLE PAST</p><p><span><IMG width="249" height="186" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_102.jpg"/></span><br/>
    </p><p class="s18">PRESENT PERFECT VS SIMPLE PAST WITH TIME EXPRESSIONS</p><p class="s19">Students: talking about present events use to be very simple. You only need to know the word for the action or state you want to express or describe and that’s it. But what about the past? <b>Actions or states in the past can have different time reference</b>, actions can be finished or unfinished, they can occur before some other past actions, or be in progress, etc. We’ll show you here how the structures change depending on the <b>time reference </b>you refer to.</p><p class="s19">This explanations will show the difference between the Present Perfect and the Simple</p><p class="s19">Past with the use of some time expressions.</p><p class="s19">Here some examples with a few of the time expressions:</p><p class="s19">1.  When the time period has NOT finished, say for instance:</p><p class="s19">“I haven’t seen yet three movies this week.” (the week hasn’t finished)</p><p class="s19">When the time period HAS finished, say:</p><p><span><IMG width="245" height="181" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_104.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s19">“I saw three movies last week.” (It was last week, so the time period is over)</p><p class="s30">Don’t look at me like that! I know its sad.</p><p class="s19">2.   When giving recent news, use: “Martin has just crashed his car.”</p><p class="s19">When giving older information, say: “Martin crashed his car last year.”</p><p><span><IMG width="289" height="161" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_105.jpg"/></span><br/>

When the time is not specific, use: “I have seen that sexy boy already.”</p><p class="s19">When the time is clear, say:</p><p><span><IMG width="277" height="234" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_107.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s19">“I saw that sexy boy on Thursday.”</p><p class="s30">Sexy Gael García Bernal <span class="s31">☺</span></p><p class="s19">4.  With ‘for and since’, when the actions have not finished yet, use: “I have lived in Barcelona since 2005.”</p><p class="s19">With ‘for and since’, when the actions have already finished, say: “I lived in Barcelona for five years.”</p><p><span><IMG width="392" height="293" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_108.jpg"/></span><br/>
    </p><p class="s18">PRESENT PERFECT VS SIMPLE PAST WITH TIME EXPRESSIONS</p><p class="s30">Barcelona: The best city in the world!</p><p class="s19">We normally use the Present Perfect when we want to talk about something which happened in the past but is relevant now. Often we use words like just/already/not ...yet with the Present Perfect.</p><p class="s19">I feel really tired. I&#39;ve just finished my report.</p><p class="s19">I haven&#39;t spoken to Brian yet but I&#39;ve already spoken to Malcolm.</p><p class="s19">We also use the Present Perfect to talk about an imprecise time in the past but as soon as we become precise we switch to the Past Simple.</p><p class="s19">I&#39;ve never been to Australia. Have you ever been there? Yes I have. I went in 1992.</p><p class="s19">The key here is to keep in mind that the <b>present perfect </b>always has a connection with the present, with &quot;now&quot;, whereas the <b>past simple </b>does not - as its name suggests, it refers to past time or past events.</p><p class="s20">I&#39;<b>ve written </b>three letters this morning (and it isn&#39;t midday yet). I <b>wrote </b>three letters this morning (and now it&#39;s afternoon).</p><p class="s19">What confuses some learners is that we do use the <b>present perfect </b>to talk about events that have finished. We can say:</p><p class="s20">I&#39;<b>ve left </b>my books at home.</p><p class="s19">Although the action of leaving the books occurred when I left home, we use the <b>present perfect </b>because there is a direct connection to the present, i.e.</p><p class="s20">I <b>haven&#39;t got </b>my books now.</p><p class="s19">Compare this to:</p><p class="s20">I <b>left </b>my books at home this morning.</p><p class="s19">Here, we are thinking of the action in the past. It is no longer morning, and whatever the result of leaving the books at home was, it has now past.</p><p class="s19">Another point is that we often use the <b>present perfect </b>to present news, but if we</p><p class="s19">continue to discuss the issue we usually change to the <b>past simple</b>:</p><p class="s20">Oh dear! I&#39;<b>ve lost </b>my wallet. Really, when <b>did </b>you last <b>have </b>it?</p><p class="s20">I <b>took </b>it out when I <b>was </b>on the bus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">THE PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS TENSE</p><p>Students: Some actions start in the past, but their result is still remaining in the present or somehow linked to it. Or sometimes perhaps the time period we refer to has not concluded yet. These are actions that have had some progress or have happened regularly within the mentioned period.<br/>Eg: <b>I have been (I’ve been) visiting </b>Paris every year since I was young.<br/>The action described took place several times in the past and is about to continue in the present or future.<br/>So, use this structure whenever you want to speak about situations which started in the past and are still continuing, or which have just finished and affect the present, and it is formed as follows:<br/>SUBJ + HAVE/HAS + BEEN + Verb -ing<br/><span><IMG width="313" height="234" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_111.png"/></span><br/>SHE HAS BEEN LIVING here for 5 years. <span style=" color: #F00;">*I live here for 5 years.

    </p><p class="s13">PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS VS PRESENT PERFECT SIMPLE</p><p>Students: The structures we are going to explain you here are used to speak about <b>situations that started in the past and are still continuing and also about situations that have just finished and affect the present</b>. The difference between the two tenses in both these situations is one of focus.<br/>If we say:<br/>I&#39;<b>ve been writing </b>e-mails all morning.

    </p><p class="s13">SUBJECT AND OBJECT QUESTIONS</p><p>Students: asking questions is something we do everyday a lot. We ask about everything, and we can do it in many ways. In English it’s usually done by inverting the usual order or adding some helping words (auxiliary verbs) at the beginning of the sentence. And of course we have the question words (wh- words). But is it always the same? Depending <b>on what information we want, we use one or another structure in the question.</b><br/>1.  When we <b>make questions </b>about the <b>person or animal who did, does or is doing the action</b>, we use the following structure:<br/>WHO + verb + rest of the sentence<br/>Eg: WHO eats fish? – We follow the usual order of elements in the sentence.</p><p class="s15">*Who DOES eat fish?

Also, when we offer or invite, the formal way of doing it is by using the structure we explain below:</p><p class="s14">To offer or invite <span class="p">we can use </span>Would you like …?</p><p>This is the <b>polite way </b>of asking or offering, and we always add polite words in the answers, such as <i><b>Yes, please. </b></i>or <i><b>No, thank you.</b></i><br/>E.g.:</p><p class="s17">-    <span class="p">Would you like a cup of coffee?</span></p><p class="s17">-    <span class="p">Oh, yes, please.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="393" height="277" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_143.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="325" height="251" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_144.png"/></span><br/>Would you like to come with me?</p><p class="s17">Would you</p><p class="s17">like me to give you a lift?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING PREFERENCES AND OFFERS WITH “WOULD LIKE”</p><p>We use I WOULD LIKE/I’D LIKE in positive sentences to ask about something you want in a polite way.</p><p class="s17">-    <span class="p">I’d like a cappuccino, please.</span></p><p class="s17">-    <span class="p">Certainly, mam.</span></p><p><span><IMG width="200" height="300" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_146.jpg"/></span><br/>Less formal is the structure <i>Do you want … (a cup of coffee)? / I want a cappuccino, please.</i><br/>
    </p><p class="s13">OFFERING AND SUGGESTING: “SHALL WE...?”</p><p>Students: There are a number of formulas used when <b>making suggestions </b>in<br/>English. Here are some of the most common:<br/>Why don&#39;t you / we go to the movies tonight?<br/>You / we could visit New York while you&#39;re / we&#39;re there.<br/>Let&#39;s go to the travel agent&#39;s this afternoon to book our ticket. What about asking your brother for help?<br/>How about going to Hawaii for your vacation?<br/>I suggest you / we take all the factors into consideration before we decide.<br/>And also, the structure we are going to explain you below: SHALL + I /WE + VERB….<br/>(Notice it is always with I or WE, but never with any other person, because you are included in the suggestion)<br/>E.g.:</p><p class="s14">Shall we go <span class="p">to a Japanese restaurant tonight?</span></p><p><span><IMG width="470" height="351" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_148.png"/></span><br/>“Shall I / we?” can be used to ask for INSTRUCTIONS, DECISIONS, in order to<br/>MAKE OFFERS and SUGGESTIONS.<br/>Ex. What on earth shall we do ?<br/>Shall I carry your bag?<br/>What time shall we come and see you? Shall we go out for a meal?<br/>
    </p><p class="s13">OFFERING AND SUGGESTING: “SHALL WE...?”</p><p class="s34">Shall we … <span class="p">can be replaced by </span>let’s… <span class="p">or </span>how about…</p><p>All those structures can be used when offering or suggesting.</p><p class="s14">But SHALL is more formal <span class="p">than others formulas.</span></p><p>Here you have some practical examples:</p><p class="s14">Let&#39;s <span class="p">dance.

    </p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING CONDITIONS WITH GENERAL TRUTH: THE ZERO CONDITIONAL</p><p>Students: the structure you are going to see below is one of the structures you will use a lot in English. It expresses the relation between reason and result, or cause and effect. Or and what is most, it expresses a <b>condition </b>for something.<br/>When we refer to <b>scientific general truths and things which always happen under certain conditions</b>, we use this structure:<br/>IF + Present simple + present simple<br/>Note: The order of these sentences can be reversed. Eg: If you leave an ice- cream in the sun, it melts. An ice cream melts if you leave it in the sun.<br/>Eg. If you give my dog a bone it buries it. (it is something that always happens, anytime you give it a bone it buries it)<br/><span><IMG width="168" height="160" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_157.jpg"/></span><br/>2) It is also used to state scientific facts.<br/>Eg. If you heat up water to 100 degrees, it boils.<br/><span><IMG width="179" height="171" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_158.jpg"/></span><br/>3) It is often used to give instructions.<br/>Eg. If you want to leave a message, speak after the tone.<br/>

    </p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING CONDITIONS IN THE PRESENT: THE 1<span class="s35">st </span>CONDITIONAL</p><p>Students: When we wish to express that we are certain that <b>something will happen if someone does something</b>, we follow this structure:<br/>IF + present simple + WILL / WILL NOT<br/>Note: The order in these sentences can be reversed! Eg. If you study hard, you will pass the exam. OR You will pass the exam if you study hard.<br/>Eg.<br/><span><IMG width="80" height="98" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_162.gif"/></span><br/>If we don’t protect the elephant, it will become extinct.<br/><span><IMG width="70" height="100" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_163.gif"/></span><br/>You will be able to see better if you turn on the lamp.<br/><span><IMG width="100" height="93" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_164.gif"/></span><br/>You won’t pass the exam if you don’t study.<br/><span><IMG width="56" height="44" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_165.gif"/></span><br/>She will look totally different if she cuts her hair.<br/>
    </p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING CONDITIONS IN THE PAST: THE 2<span class="s35">nd </span>CONDITIONAL</p><p>Students: Sometimes we talk about imaginary situations, that is, situations that are not real. For example, you have not much money, but you imagine you do. When we want to express the possible result in an imaginary situation, we use this structure:<br/>IF + PAST SIMPLE + WOULD + Verb<br/>IF + PAST SIMPLE + WOULD NOT/ WOULDN’T+ Verb<br/>Note: These sentences can be reversed.<br/>Eg. If <b>I were rich I would buy </b>a Ferrari OR I would buy a Ferrari if I were rich. This sentence means that I am not rich but I imagine what I would do if I were.<br/><span><IMG width="172" height="265" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_167.gif"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="294" height="220" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_168.png"/></span><br/>This structure can be used used to talk about <b>imaginary present situations</b>, where we are imagining something different from what is really the case. We can also use it to talk about things in the future that are unlikely to happen, as the condition is unlikely to be met. We use the past tense in the <b>condition </b>part and <b>would </b>for the result.<br/>If I had a motorbike, I wouldn’t have to wait for the bus every morning. (but I<br/>don´t have a motorbike, I’m just imagining it)<br/>

    </p><p class="s13">THE PASSIVE VOICE: PRESENT TENSES</p><p>Students: Let’s have a look at the following sentence: My brother builds this house.<br/><span><IMG width="191" height="162" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_173.gif"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="268" height="284" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_174.jpg"/></span><br/>It is a normal way to construct a sentence. However, we can change the focus and say:<br/>This house is built by my brother.<br/><span><IMG width="159" height="168" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_175.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="288" height="245" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_176.gif"/></span><br/>In this second sentence, we change the focus and give more importance to the thing than to the person who performs the action.<br/>We use this structure when we focus on what happens to a thing or a person and not on WHO performs the action.<br/>The structure is:<br/>
    </p><p class="s13">THE PASSIVE VOICE: PRESENT TENSES</p><p>THING/PERSON + To be + past participle + By person (if we want to specify who performs the action)<br/><span><IMG width="90" height="128" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_178.jpg"/></span><br/>Eg.

    </p><p class="s13">THE PASSIVE VOICE: PAST AND FUTURE TENSES</p><p>Whenever we want to put more emphasis on the object/objects or receiver /receivers of an action and “ignore” the performer, we use a structure that allow us to put that receiver at the beginning of the sentence and hide the doer of the action. The person speaking could think that it is necessary to place more emphasis on the object/objects or receiver/receivers of an action.<br/>We do the same when we do not know who is performing the action, or it is not apparent who is performing the action. An animal or an inanimate object could be performing the action as well.<br/>Here are some examples for past and future time reference:</p><p class="s16">*Past time reference:</p><p>Brad Pitt wrote “Interview with a Vampire.” (Active)<br/><span><IMG width="215" height="225" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_186.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14">“Interview with a Vampire” was written by Brad Pitt.

    </p><p class="s13">THE PASSIVE VOICE: PAST AND FUTURE TENSES</p><p>In English, that structure is used very often. Find below some of the reasons of using it with clarifying examples:</p><p class="s14">1. <span class="p">When the agent of the action is unknown:</span></p><p>My wallet <b>was stolen </b>last night. (we don’t know who stole the wallet)</p><p class="s14">2. <span class="p">When the agent is unimportant:</span></p><p>The new students’ centre <b>was completed </b>last week. (the people who built the centre are unnecessary information for the meaning of the sentence)</p><p class="s14">3. <span class="p">When the agent of the action is obvious from the context:</span></p><p>I <b>was born </b>in March of &#39;55. (Everyone knows that it was my mother bore me then)</p><p class="s14">4. <span class="p">To emphasize (put importance on) the recipient (receiver) of the action:</span></p><p>a. Only Jane <b>was injured </b>in the accident; the remainder of the passengers were unhurt.(we want Jane to be the subject of the sentence and at the beginning to emphasize her importance)<br/>b. Erina <b>was chosen </b>as best student, and of course this made her happy. (the</p><p class="s14">teacher <span class="p">who chose Erina is not what we want to emphasize)</span></p><p class="s14">5. <span class="p">To connect ideas in different clauses more clearly:</span></p><p>a. Pharmacologists would like to study the natural ‘pharmacy’ known as the rainforest, if this <b>can be done </b>before clear-cutting destroys it. (in this sentence, keeping THIS near the first clause makes the sentence’s meaning clearer)<br/>b. The music was being played too loud by the students, who <b>were finally asked </b>to turn it down.</p><p class="s14">6. <span class="p">To make generic statements, announcements, and explanations:</span></p><p>a. Something <b>should be done </b>about the traffic jams in this town. b. Patrons <b>are asked </b>not to smoke.<br/>c. <b>It&#39;s said </b>that it&#39;s going to rain tonight.(Often, people will say, &#39;They say that it&#39;s going to rain tonight&#39;, the <b>they </b>being the weatherman.)<br/>

The restaurant was very expensive. The Italian restaurant WHERE WE WENT LAST NIGHT was very expensive.<br/>

OK, It could</p><p class="s17">have been</p><p class="s17">me...</p><p class="s14">WHOSE</p><p>That man has a son. His son is 10 years old. The man has lived here for 5 years.<br/>The man WHOSE SON IS 10 YEARS OLD has lived here for 5 years<br/>
      </p><p class="s13">RELATIVE CLAUSES AND CONJUNCTIONS IN RELATIVE CLAUSES</p><p>Sometimes we can omit the word that relates the two logical parts of the sentence. This often happens with the word THAT. Look at the examples above. They are both correct.<br/>Eg.: The restaurant <b>that </b>you like is near the bank. / The restaurant you like is near the bank. (relative word omitted).<br/>This happens whenever it’s not the subject you are referring to, but the object. But if we give information about the subject, we need the relative word.<br/>Eg.: The restaurant <b>which </b>opens late is near the bank.<br/>Now look at these sentences.<br/>Pair 1: You looked at a girl. She was blonde. (The agent here is YOU)<br/>Pair 2: A girl looked at you. She was blonde. (The agent here is the GIRL) When we try to join them in one, that’s what we have:<br/>Pair 1: The girl you looked at was blonde.<br/>Pair 2: The girl who looked at you was blonde.<br/>Obviously, the changes depend on who is looking at who, whether you at the girl, or the girl at you!<br/>

It’s easy and very common, but still necessary to use properly.</span></p><p class="s14">1) BECAUSE</p><p>When we explain the reason why something happens, we use BECAUSE. It is the answer to the questions WHY?<br/>I go to they gym every day BECAUSE I want to lose weight. (the second part of the sentence answers the questions “Why do you go to the gym?”<br/><span><IMG width="359" height="245" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_214.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14">2) SO</p><p>When we explain the reason for an action that we have just mentioned, we use<br/>SO.<br/><span><IMG width="240" height="240" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_215.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="37" height="8" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_216.png"/></span><br/>Eg: He is very tired, so he is going to bed.

      </p><p class="s13">THE USE OF CONJUNCTIONS TO EXPRESS CONTRAST</p><p>Often, when we talk, we need to link or join two or more ideas. In that cases, we use connectors or words often called conjunctions.<br/>More often than not, they are simply referred to as &quot;joining words&quot;. <i>And, but, so, although, since and however </i>are some commonly used connectors to express <b>contrast</b>.<br/>Here are just a few examples:</p><p class="s14">*The use of ´but´: <span class="p">(By using &#39;but&#39;, the speaker can contrast the two ideas and emphasise the second idea.)</span></p><p>1.  The cheerleaders rehearse on Tuesday, <b>but </b>the mascots rehearse on<br/><span><IMG width="366" height="205" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_223.jpg"/></span><br/>Wednesday.<br/>Go team, go!<br/>2.  I love being with my boyfriend, <b>but </b>I also love to be alone.<br/><span><IMG width="170" height="264" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_224.jpg"/></span><br/>
      </p><p class="s13">THE USE OF CONJUNCTIONS TO EXPRESS CONTRAST</p><p class="s14">*The use of ´although´: <span class="p">(Note that ‘although’ and ‘but’ express the same idea of contrast. So, if ‘although’ is used, ‘but’ cannot be used in the same sentence.)</span></p><p>1.  I wanted to sit in the front row, <b>although </b>I was just as happy sitting in the back.<br/><span><IMG width="461" height="307" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_226.jpg"/></span><br/>2.  I know how to speak English, <b>although </b>I wouldn’t mind learning to speak perfect Xinese.</p><p class="s14">*The use of ´however´: <span class="p">(it is used to make contrast between two sentences)</span></p><p>1.  We have tickets for the basketball game; <b>however </b>we don’t have tickets for the FC Barcelona match between Real Madrid.<br/><span><IMG width="354" height="217" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_227.jpg"/></span><br/>
      </p><p class="s13">THE USE OF CONJUNCTIONS TO EXPRESS CONTRAST</p><p>2.  Real Madrid is a good team; <b>however </b>FC Barcelona is much better.<br/><span><IMG width="358" height="261" src="http://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S3/Image_229.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14">But, although and however <span class="p">are some of the most common linking words when expressing contrast. But there are some more. Here you have some of them with clarifying examples:</span></p><p class="s14">Even though</p><p>We use “even though” when the contrast is particularly STRONG.<br/>eg. &quot;Even though there are about 800.000 words in English, many English speakers only use about 5.000.&quot;<br/>(big contrast: 800.000&gt;5.000)</p><p class="s14">Though</p><p>We can use “though” instead of  “although”.<br/>eg. &quot;They can try to learn 800.000 words, though they only need to know about<br/>2.000.&quot;<br/>We can use “though” (not “although”) AT THE END of a sentence.<br/>eg. &quot;It isn’t the most widely-used language in the world, though.&quot; (=But it isn’t the most widely-used language in the world.)</p><p class="s14">In spite of</p><p>“In spite of” is usually FOLLOWED by a noun, a pronoun or the –ing form of verb.<br/>
      </p><p class="s13">THE USE OF CONJUNCTIONS TO EXPRESS CONTRAST</p><p>eg. &quot;In spite of the difficulty, more and more people are starting to learn English every year.&quot;<br/>(= although it’s difficult, more and more people …)<br/>&quot;In spite of being the most widely used language, it isn’t spoken by many people outside China.&quot;<br/>(=although it’s the most widely-used language)<br/>We can also use the expression IN SPITE OF HE FACT THAT.<br/>eg. &quot;In spite of the fact that it’s the most widely used language, it isn’t spoken by many people outside China.&quot;<br/>More connector, although not expressing contrast are:</p><p class="s14">Because, since, as</p><p>We use the link words “because, since” and “as” when we want to say WHY we do something or why something or why something happens. We normally use<br/>“because” to give the REASON, and the “because” clause usually comes at the end. We normally use “since” and “as” when the reason is already KNOWN.<br/>“Since” and “as” mean the same.<br/>eg. &quot;Many people from Europe and South America go to the USA because they need to do business there.&quot; And since (or as) they have to speak to Americans, they have to learn English.)</p><p class="s14">So</p><p>We use the link word &quot;so&quot; to talk about the RESULT of an action or situation.<br/>

<p class="s13">PREFERENCES AND SUGGESTIONS WITH “WOULD, RATHER, BETTER, SOONER, PREFER”, ETC.</p><p>This is a very simple and rather common structure to use in spoken English. You want to use this structure when you want to talk about your or others preferences and suggestions. With this specific structure you can not only state what you prefer or want to suggest, but you also state what you don’t want to do or say. For example, “I would rather go swimming than go fishing because swimming is more fun!”<br/>Here are some more examples of this structure:<br/>1.  Would rather…<br/>“I’d rather see Robbie Williams in concert than Ricky Martin.”<br/><span><IMG width="276" height="225" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14">(Sexy!)</p><p>2.

Here are <b>TWO </b>more expressions that can and are used to express past actions. The two expressions are: “to have something done” and “to get something done.”<br/>This construction may describe <b>situations where we want someone else to do something for us.</b><br/>Examples:<br/>a. I must get / have my hair cut.<br/>b. When are you going to get that window mended?<br/>c. We&#39;re having the house painted.<br/>If the verb refers to something negative or unwanted, it has the same meaning as<br/>a passive sentence:<br/>d. Jim had his car stolen last night. (= Jim&#39;s car was stolen)<br/>e. They had their roof blown off in the storm. (= Their roof was blown off in the storm)<br/>The construction can refer to the completion of an activity, especially if a time expression is used:<br/>f. We&#39;ll get the work done as soon as possible.<br/>g. I&#39;ll get those letters typed before lunchtime.<br/>In all these sentences, we are more interested in the result of the activity than in<br/>the person or object that performs the activity.<br/>&#39;X&#39; NEEDS DOING<br/>In the same way, this construction has a passive meaning. The important thing in<br/>our minds is the person or thing that will experience the action, e.g. a. The ceiling needs painting (= the ceiling needs to be painted)<br/>b. My hair needs cutting (= my hair needs to be cut)<br/>Here are some illustrated examples:<br/>

In informal language the “if” structure usually is enough for the purposes of everyday communication, but in formal language we have a variety of forms synonymous to “if” and these structures are widely used in written language, or in speeches, presentations, meetings, etc.</span></p><p>Here you will find other ways to express conditional statements.<br/>-<b>‘If’ and adjectives</b>: When you use the verb ‘to be’ plus an adjective, what happens is that the subject and the verb of the ‘if’ clause can be omitted. And the result clause follows in the imperative form.<br/>For example:<br/>We need shop assistants. If interested, apply for the job inside the shop. (if you are interested, … - “you are” is omitted).<br/><span><IMG width="405" height="218" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_046.jpg"/></span><br/>-<b>‘Provided (that)’, ‘as long as’</b>: ‘Provided (that)’ and ‘as long as’ are used instead of ‘if’ to show specific conditions that must be met in order for something to happen.<br/>For example:<br/>Provided he does his work, he’ll get a good grade.<br/>

      </p><p class="s13">OTHER WAYS OF EXPRESSING CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</p><p>-<b>‘Were to’</b>: If followed by subject + ‘were to’ emphasizes the hypothetical character of the statement.<br/>For example:<br/>If they were to buy a new dog, what would they feed it?<br/><span><IMG width="158" height="198" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_052.jpg"/></span><br/>-<b>‘If were not for’</b>: this statement emphasizes that one event depends on another for completion. It is usually used to show negative results without a certain person or thing.<br/>For example:<br/>If it weren’t for his mistakes, the US economy wouldn’t be so low.<br/><span><IMG width="229" height="172" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_053.jpg"/></span><br/>-<b>‘Supposing’</b>: It is used in place of ‘if’ to emphasize the imaginary.

It is usually used in formal speech.<br/>For example:<br/><span><IMG width="157" height="202" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_057.jpg"/></span><br/>But for our savings, we wouldn’t have been able to make the payments.

      </p><p class="s13">OTHER WAYS OF EXPRESSING CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</p><p>-<b>‘If it hadn’t been for’</b>: It emphasizes an event that depended on another for completion. It is normally used to show what the negative results would have been without a certain person or thing.<br/>For example:<br/>If it hadn’t been for my father, I would have died.<br/><span><IMG width="135" height="188" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_059.jpg"/></span><br/>-<b>Mixed Conditional</b>: When you used this structure to express a present hypothetical result that is based on a past action.<br/>For example:<br/>If she hadn’t saved me, I wouldn’t be standing now.<br/><span><IMG width="177" height="149" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_060.jpg"/></span><br/>

What they have in common is that all of them act the same way a simple noun, adjective or adverb would do. But we need these complex formulas because we have complex ideas to express. Just remember this: these structures express ideas or concepts but behave like simples nouns, adjectives or adverbs. You will understand this better by means of the examples.<br/>Both gerunds and infinitives can be nouns, which means they can do just about anything that a noun can do. Although they name things, like other nouns, they normally name activities rather than people or objects. Here are some noun-uses of gerunds and infinitives.<br/>a.  <b>Playing basketball </b>takes up too much of her time.<br/>b.  <b>To play basketball for UConn </b>is her favourite fantasy. c.  Her favourite fantasy is <b>to play basketball for UConn.</b><br/>The gerund can also play this role:<br/>d.  Her favourite fantasy is <b>playing basketball for UConn.</b><br/>Also, we use these structures to join sentences in English:</p><p class="s16">Here is a more extensive example:</p><p>I had seen people at a restaurant.

It can be a substitute of many actions expressed by other verbs, as it contains the idea of becoming, achieving something. Its use is especially noticeable in American English.

        </p><p class="s13">RELATIVE CLAUSES: PREPOSITIONS IN RELATIVE CLAUSES</p><p class="s16">Students: <span class="p">When we want to express complex ideas, such as explaining an event, or telling a story or presenting facts, we often link several related ideas in sentences.  In these cases -when we have complex sentences- the linking particles (prepositions or pronouns) and their correct use are extremely important.</span></p><p>Let’s consider the following example:<br/>“She arrived with a man. That man is her boyfriend.”<br/>If we want to join these sentences in one, we have to do some changes in the structure.<br/>The man (who) she arrived <i><b>with </b></i>is her boyfriend.<br/>The linking word (who) can often be omitted. And the preposition follows the verb, although is no longer followed by the object (a man).<br/><span><IMG width="190" height="277" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_271.jpg"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="164" height="86" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_272.png"/></span></p><p class="s28">Is that the man (who) you arrived <i><b>with</b></i><i>?</i></p><p class="s14">Yes, I am, leaver her alone!</p><p><span><IMG width="422" height="217" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_273.png"/></span></p><p class="s28">Do you know the girl (that) you are looking <i><b>at</b></i><i>?</i></p><p class="s14">Don’t be jealous she’s just a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">RELATIVE CLAUSES: PREPOSITIONS IN RELATIVE CLAUSES</p><p class="s28">1.  In formal or written English, the preposition is often placed before the relative pronoun, and in this case the pronoun cannot be omitted:</p><p class="s30">The person <b>with whom </b>he is dancing is the heir of a large company. The person he is dancing <b>with </b>is the heir of a large company. <span class="s28">(also</span></p><p><span><IMG width="429" height="223" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_275.png"/></span></p><p class="s28">possible)</p><p class="s14">I’m going to be a rich man!

Obviously, this is only necessary if there is more than one person or thing involved.<br/>Example:<br/>Elephants who marry mice are very unusual.<br/>In this sentence we understand that there are many elephants, but it is clear that we are only talking the ones who marry mice.<br/>RELATIVE PRONOUNS<br/>The following relative pronouns are used in defining relative clauses:<br/>REASON<br/>PERSON                 THING                     PLACE          TIME<br/>Subject         Who/That                 Which/That<br/>Object           Who/Whom/That/Ø Which/That/Ø          Where           When<br/>Why<br/>Possessive   Whose                     Whose<br/>Examples:<br/>The woman  who/that        spoke at the meeting          was very knowledgeable.<br/>2.  WHO, WHOM AND WHICH can be replaced by THAT. This is very common in spoken English.<br/>3.  The relative pronoun can be OMITTED (ø):<br/>The mouse that the elephant loved was very beautiful. OR     The mouse the elephant loved was very beautiful.<br/>Both of these sentences are correct, though the second one is more common in spoken English.<br/>4.  WHOSE is used for things as well as for PEOPLE.<br/>Examples:<br/>The <b>man whose car </b>was stolen is in the police station now.<br/>A <b>tree whose leaves </b>have fallen is means that autumn is near.<br/>
        </p><p class="s13">RELATIVE CLAUSES: PREPOSITIONS IN RELATIVE CLAUSES</p><p>5.  WHOM is very formal and is only used in written English. You can use</p><p class="s17">who/that,  <span class="p">or omit the pronoun completely:</span></p><p>The <b>doctor whom/who/that/ø </b>I was hoping to see wasn’t on duty.<br/>6. THAT normally follows words like <i>something, anything, everything, nothing, all</i>, and superlatives.<br/>Examples:<br/>There’s something that you should know.<br/>A clown is someone who makes you laugh.<br/>
        </p><p class="s13">PHRASAL VERBS</p><p>English is a very, very rich language. For similar concepts, we can find different words or phrases that express the same. For instance, we can say <b>enter </b>or <b>come in </b>meaning the same. In this second case, we use a very common verb followed by another particle (a preposition). These kind of verbs followed by a fixed prepositions are very used in current English. The new combination creates a meaning different from the original verb.<br/><span><IMG width="553" height="280" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_287.png"/></span><br/>Example:</p><p class="s31"><span class="p">I </span><span class="s20">ran into</span><span class="p"> my teacher at the movies last night. </span>RUN <span class="s18">+ </span>INTO <span class="s18">= </span>MEET</p><p class="s14">It’s so nice to run into you ☺</p><p><span><IMG width="376" height="293" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_288.png"/></span></p><p class="s31"><span class="p">He </span><span class="s20">ran away</span><span class="p"> when he was 15. </span>RUN <span class="s18">+ </span>AWAY <span class="s18">= </span>LEAVE HOME</p><p class="s14">I am never going home! I ran away because I don’t like my mom!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">PHRASAL VERBS</p><p><br/>In some cases, after the preposition we don’t add anything else, that is the phrase doesn’t need further complements to create a meaningful statement.<br/>Example:<br/><span><IMG width="247" height="296" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_291.png"/></span><br/>He suddenly <u>showed up</u>. <i><b>&quot;</b></i><span class="s31">SHOW UP</span><i><b>&quot; </b></i><span class="s31">APPEARED</span></p><p class="s14">Did you prefer for me to</p><p class="s14">call first?</p><p><span><IMG width="553" height="54" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_292.png"/></span><br/>But in some other cases, we do need to complement the verb in order to create a meaningful statement.<br/>Example:<br/><span><IMG width="409" height="206" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_293.png"/></span><br/>I <u>made up</u> <span style=" color: #326599;">the story</span>. <i><b>&quot;</b></i><span class="s31">MAKE UP</span><i><b>&quot; </b></i><span class="s31">INVENT</span></p><p class="s14">You believed me?

the arrangement of its parts, but refers instead to a figurative meaning that is known only through conventional use.<br/>In the English expression “to kick the bucket”, a listener knowing only the meaning of “kick” and “bucket” would be unable to deduce the expression&#39;s actual meaning, which is “to die”. Although it can refer literally to the act of striking a bucket with a foot, native speakers rarely use it that way.<br/>Below you will find some examples of common English, American, and<br/>Australian idioms.

        </p><p class="s13">COLLOQUIAL LANGUAGE AND SLANG</p><p class="s16">Colloquial language <span class="p">and </span>Slang <span class="p">is informal, street language, which uses expressions that many would consider to be grammatically imperfect and sometimes rude. Slang (along with colloquial) is often used within small social groups where it can help draw and keep the group together. It changes very quickly in English.</span></p><p>For example, in English we use “You’re pulling my leg!” in order to expresses that someone/thing is trying to fool us. We use such expressions without thinking about what we are saying (colloquial language). For those who are not natives of English they would take an expression literally, that someone is pulling their leg.<br/>The list of slang expressions would be extremely long to be included here, and every day more and more expressions are invented, based on current events that last short in time. Still, some of them remain in time and achieve some popularity within English speaking communities.<br/>Find below some examples of COLLOQUIAL and SLANG LANGUAGE, just to illustrate how this phenomenon works in English.<br/>-She’s <b>acting like a fool</b>!

Why? Because it refers to the pitch or melody used during the pronunciation of the statement. It is important for you to note that the pitch of the voice can rise, fall, or stay the same during the pronunciation of words, phrases and utterances.<br/>The full description of intonation patterns is very complex. Here, only some fundamental points will be explained.<br/>Within each tone group, there will be the normal English combination of stressed (strong) and unstressed (weak) syllables.<br/><span class="s37">o  </span>It was the <u>best car</u> for them to <u>buy</u>.<br/>Within the tone group, one syllable will be even more strongly stressed than<br/>the other stressed syllables. This is called the nuclear syllable.<br/><span><IMG width="445" height="225" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_334.png"/></span><br/><span class="s37">o  </span>It was the best car for them to <u>buy</u>.

It also has a <b>change of pitch</b>.<br/>The effects of the rising or falling pitch can be seen very clearly on sentences with tag questions.</p><p class="s37">o  <span class="p">They&#39;re coming on Monday / aren&#39;t they? (with falling intonation you are  anticipating the listener&#39;s agreement)</span></p><p class="s37">o  <span class="p">They&#39;re coming on Monday / aren&#39;t they?

It is by changing the pitch that we can indicate certainty, uncertainty, enthusiasm, boredom, and so on. We can say &quot;yes&quot; so that it almost means &quot;no&quot;. As listeners, we become skilled at detecting fine shades of meaning in other people&#39;s speech. We can say they sounded unhappy, tired, sneering, self-satisfied, sarcastic, and so on. These attitudes are picked up from very fine variations in pitch and loudness.<br/>Although intonation is an important feature of spoken English, it is represented in written English only rather crudely by the use of such punctuation devices as full stops, commas, question marks, and exclamation marks.<br/><span><IMG width="366" height="284" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_340.png"/></span><br/>&quot;How are you today?&quot; he asked   cheerfully. laconically. bitterly. wistfully.</p><p class="s14">How are you today?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">INTONATION IN STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS WITH OR WITHOUT QUESTION WORD</p><p><span><IMG width="579" height="448" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S5/Image_342.png"/></span><br/>The summarize, find below some basic “rules” about intonation:<br/>The intonation pattern used gives information about whether an utterance is a statement or a question, the type of question and expected response, or whether something is part of a series of items, or something on its own.<br/>In a statement, the intonation falls on the last syllable of a sentence.<br/>e.g.,                      .<br/>There is a similar pattern in an information (WH) question; these structures are identified by both the question word that starts the sentence and by the intonation pattern.<br/>e.g.,<br/>An information question contrasts with a “yes/no” question in which the intonation rises on the final syllable.<br/>e.g.,<br/>In a series, the first item(s) has rising intonation and the last one has falling intonation.<br/>e.g.,<br/>

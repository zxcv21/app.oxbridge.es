You would say something like: “I’m doing the laundry now.” Now imagine that at the same time one week later you plan to do the same. You would say something like “This time next week <b>I will be doing </b>the laundry again.” Well, this is how it works.<br/>We use the future continuous when we intend or plan to do something at a specific time in the future.<br/><span><IMG width="608" height="74" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_063.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="45" height="12" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_064.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="37" height="12" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_065.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="25" height="12" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_066.png"/></span><br/>Form:<br/>Affirmative: S + Will + be + V - ing Negative: S+ Won&#39;t + be + V -ing Interrogative: Will + S + be + V -ing?<br/>Usage:<br/>When we talk about an activity or event going on at a PARTICULAR TIME or over a PARTICULAR PERIOD in the future.

In this case, we need to <b>specify </b>the period of time the future action will have taken place.<br/>Imagine that you want to say that today you have eaten 2 toasts. And tomorrow you want to eat 2 more. That means that in two days time <b>you will have eaten </b>four toasts. And this is how it works.<br/>As this structure expresses an action taking place in the future, we can’t use it in clauses beginning with &quot;when,&quot; &quot;while,&quot; &quot;before,&quot; &quot;after,&quot; &quot;by the time,&quot; &quot;as soon as,&quot; &quot;if&quot; and &quot;unless&quot;.<br/>EXAMPLES:<br/>I am going to see a movie when I <u>have finished</u> my homework.

I used to smoke, but now I don’t even touch a cigarette.</p><p class="s9">There used to be a church at the top of that hill.

(=he used to take me fishing with him.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">EXPRESSING PAST HABITS: USED TO, WOULD, BE / GET USED TO</p><p class="s9">GET USED TO + NOUN or verb + -ING and BE USED TO + NOUN or verb +</p><p class="s9">–ING means to <b>become used to</b>, <b>to acquire a habit</b>. If somebody <b>gets </b>or <b>is used </b>to something, he becomes or is fully familiar with it. It is no longer strange</p><p class="s9">or awkward. It can refer to past, present or future experiences. They can always be replaced by <b>be </b>or <b>become accustomed to </b>which is very similar in meaning,</p><p class="s9">if a little more formal.</p><p class="s9">Eg. Young drivers must get used to driving in heavy traffic as soon as possible.

It’s not the custom in our country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">TAG QUESTIONS IN ALL TENSES AND AUXILIARIES</p><p class="s9">If you think that English is difficult and want to check if the person you are addressing to agrees with you, you add a short question at the end your statement. EG.</p><p class="s15">English is <span class="s9">difficult, </span>isn’t it?</p><p class="s9">This short question is used to verify or check information that we think is true or  to  check  information  that  we  aren&#39;t  sure  is  true.  Normally  a  positive statement is followed by a negative tag, and a negative statement is followed by a positive tag. The verb in the statement should be the same tense as the verb in the tag.</p><p class="s9">Eg. <b>It was </b>a very good party, <b>wasn’t it? </b>(the meaning is something like: Do you agree that it was a very good party? <b>or </b>Will you confirm that it was a very good party?)</p><p class="s15">It wasn’t <span class="s9">a very good party, </span>was it<span class="s9">?</span></p><p class="s9">The statement and the tag are always separated by a comma.</p><p class="s9">Notice that any statements with <b>nothing, nobody </b>etc should be treated like negative statements.</p><p class="s9">Eg. <b>Nothing </b>lasts forever, <b>does it?</b></p><p class="s9"><b>Nobody </b>knows, <b>do </b>they? (we use <i>they </i>to replace <i>nobody)</i></p><p class="s9">If a modal (can, could, will, should, etc.) is used in the statement, then the same modal is used in the tag part. If the statement doesn&#39;t use an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary <i>do </i>is used in the tag part.</p><p class="s9">The event was really touching, wasn’t it? We had a good time, didn’t we?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">TAG QUESTIONS IN ALL TENSES AND AUXILIARIES</p><p class="s15">Special cases:</p><p class="s15">Question tags with imperatives</p><p class="s9">Sometimes we use question tags with imperatives (invitations, orders), but the sentence remains an imperative and does not require a direct answer. We use <i>won&#39;t </i>for invitations. We use <i>can, can&#39;t, will, would </i>for orders.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s30">Function</p></td><td><p class="s30">imperative   +   question tag</p></td><td><p class="s31">notes:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Invitation</p></td><td><p class="s30">Take a seat, won&#39;t you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">polite</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Order</p></td><td><p class="s30">Help me, can you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">quite friendly</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Order</p></td><td><p class="s30">Help me, can&#39;t you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">quite friendly (some irritation?)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Order</p></td><td><p class="s30">Close  the  door,  would you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">quite polite</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Order</p></td><td><p class="s30">Do it now, will you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">less polite</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">Order</p></td><td><p class="s30">Don&#39;t forget, will you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">with  negative  imperatives only  <i>will  </i>is possible</p></td></tr></table><p class="s15">Same-way question tags</p><p class="s9">Although the basic structure of tag questions is positive-negative or negative- positive, it is sometime possible to use a positive-positive or negative-negative structure. We use same-way question tags to express interest, surprise, anger etc, and not to make real questions.</p><p class="s9">So you&#39;re having a baby, are you? That&#39;s wonderful! She wants to marry him, does she? Some chance! So you think that&#39;s amusing, do you? Think again.</p><p class="s9">Negative-negative tag questions usually sound rather hostile: So you don&#39;t like my looks, don&#39;t you?</p><p class="s15">More special cases:</p><p class="s9">With suggestions, we use <i>shall: Let’s go, </i><i><b>shall we?</b></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s13">TAG QUESTIONS IN ALL TENSES AND AUXILIARIES</p><p class="s9">I <b>am </b>right, <b>are</b>n&#39;t I?

With rising intonation, it sounds like a real question. But if our intonation falls, it sounds more like a statement that doesn&#39;t require a real answer:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td/><td><p class="s30">intonation</p></td><td/></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">You don&#39;t know where my wallet is,</p></td><td><p class="s30">do you?</p></td><td><p class="s30">/ rising</p></td><td><p class="s30">real question</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s30">It&#39;s a beautiful view,</p></td><td><p class="s30">isn&#39;t it?</p></td><td><p class="s30">\ falling</p></td><td><p class="s30">not a real question</p></td></tr></table><p class="s15">Answers to tag questions</p><p class="s9">How do we answer a tag question? Often, we just say Yes or No. Sometimes we may repeat the tag and reverse it (..., do they? Yes, they do). Be very careful  about  answering  tag  questions.  In  some  languages,  an  opposite system of answering is used, and non-native English speakers sometimes answer in the wrong way. This can lead to a lot of confusion!</p><p class="s9">For example, everyone knows that snow is white.

This is the <b>wrong answer </b>in English!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s23">SHORT ANSWERS AND REPLY QUESTIONS</p><p>When we talk to somebody and want to express <b>surprise </b>with what we heard, one of the structures you can use is the one you have below.<br/>We use the so called <i>reply questions </i>when we DON’T AGREE, or we AREN’T SURE, or if we are SURPRISED with what another person says. For example, a reply with something such as: ‘really?’ or ‘is that true?’<br/>This structure should be very easy because it’s simply a short answer (of any kind) and a reply question to that answer. <b>The tag in the reply question agrees in tense with the main verb it refers to.</b><br/>In English we use that structure a lot, you’ve probably heard it in films, series, etc.<br/>Below you will find some examples.</p><p class="s24">EXAMPLES:</p><p class="s25">-    <span class="p">I love to watch the Superman series.</span></p><p class="s24"><span class="s25">-    </span>Oh!

What is interesting about this verbs, commonly known as modal verbs, is that the structures  that they form are autonomous,  that is they don’t need other helpling (auxiliary) verbs to make the interrogative or the negative forms.<br/>Let’s see how they work:<br/>We  use  MUST  HAVE  +  PAST  PARTICIPLE  to  say  we’re    ALMOST  CERTAIN something happened in the past, because of the information we have. We use CAN&#39;T HAVE (NOT  mustn’t have) + PAST PARTICIPLE to say we think something        was impossible.<br/>Ex. It must have sunk immediately. (Nothing was found.)<br/>He can’t have run out of fuel.    (Impossible. He had plenty.)<br/>We can use either MAY HAVE, MIGHT HAVE or COULD HAVE + a PAST PARTICIPLE<br/>to say that something POSSIBLE in the past.<br/>Ex. It may have fallen asleep. (= It’s possible it’s fallen asleep.)<br/>It might have gone under the floorboards. (=That’s possible.) It could have gone down the toilet.(=That’s possible.)<br/>COULD HAVE can also mean that something was possible, but DIDN&#39;T HAPPEN.<br/>Ex. I could have given it some food this morning. (He didn’t give it any food.) Note the NEGATIVE FORMS: may not have/ might not (n’t) have.<br/>Ex. I might not have put the cover on.(= It’s possible I didn’t.) COULDN&#39;T HAVE means that something was TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE.<br/>Ex. A thief couldn’t have got into the house. (= It wasn’t possible.)<br/>We  use  SHOULD  HAVE  or  OUGHT  TO  HAVE  +  a  PAST  PARTICIPLE  to  say something in the past was a MISTAKE.<br/>Ex. I shouldn’t have taken the car. (But he took it. It was a mistake.)<br/>You should have been watching the road.(But he wasn’t watching the road.) You oughtn’t to have been eating a hamburger.

      </p><p class="s23">THE PASSIVE VOICE: PERFECT AND CONTINUOUS TENSES</p><p>Every time you need to put emphasis on the receiver of an action, instead of the performer, we invert the order of the statement and put the important information at the beginning. Of course that implies some other changes in the structure of the sentence that we’ll explain right now.<br/>This way of emphasizing is more commonly used in English than it is in other European languages such as German or French. As well as being used in everyday English, we can find this structure extensively in official documents and scientific papers.<br/>Here are some examples:<br/>The boy stroke the ball.<br/>(Note: here we use the usual order of the sentence.

(=because it was a public holiday)<br/>We watched television all evening as we had nothing better to do.<br/>“As” also is used when two things happen at the same time:<br/>I watched her as she opened the letter (‘I watched’ and ‘she opened’ at the same time).<br/>Can you turn off the light as you go out , please? (=on your way out<br/>of the room)<br/>“As”, “when” and “while”.<br/>We use only if two things happen at the same time. We use when<br/>(not ‘as’) if one thing happens after another.

      </p><p class="s23">REPORTED SPEECH WITH AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF TENSES</p><p>Something very usual when we speak is to say or <b>report </b>other people’s words. How to do it depends on one very simple thing: when the event or action that we report takes place. Depending on that, and having in mind that we report always later in time, we have to refer to the event or action using tenses that express earlier moments (past tenses).<br/>However, sometimes changes do not occur. Normally there is no tense change, if the reporting verb is in the present tense. This is because there is no important change of time or circumstances. However, what is said by somebody is often reported subsequently at a different time and in a different place. This change of time nearly always results in a change of tense.</p><p class="s24">1.  Reported Speech without tense change:</p><p>Example 1:   A: “I&#39;ve got no idea where Australia is.”<br/><span><IMG width="539" height="235" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_211.png"/></span><br/>B: “She says she&#39;s got no idea where Australia is.”</p><p class="s25">I’ve got no idea where Australia is!</p><p class="s25">She says she&#39;s got no idea where Australia is.</p><p>Example 2:         A: “I haven&#39;t seen him since he came out of prison”<br/><span><IMG width="538" height="211" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_212.png"/></span><br/>B: “He claims he hasn&#39;t seen him since he came out of prison.”</p><p class="s25">I haven’t seen him since he came out of prison.</p><p class="s25">He claims he hasn’t seen him since he came out of prison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="s23">REPORTED SPEECH WITH AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF TENSES</p><p class="s24">2.</p><p class="s24">3.

Thus, the verbs have past time references.<br/>Question without question words (yes/no questions):<br/>Peter: &quot;Do you play football?&quot; - Peter asked me whether (if) I played football.<br/>Question with question words:<br/>Peter: &quot;When do you play football?&quot; - Peter asked me when I<br/>played football.

This is because when we use reported speech, we are usually talking about a time in the past, since obviously the person who spoke originally spoke in the past. The verbs therefore usually have to be in the past too. Example: He said: &quot;I´m going to the cinema&quot; - He said he was going to the cinema.<br/>The conditionals and modals also change:<br/>-WILL &gt; WOULD.<br/>E.g: She said, &quot;I´ll teach English tomorrow&quot;<br/>She said she would teach English the next day.<br/>-CAN &gt; COULD.<br/>E.g: She said, &quot;I can teach English&quot; She said she could teach English.<br/>-MUST &gt; HAD TO.<br/>E.g: She said, &quot;I must have a computer to teach English&quot; She said she had to have a computer to teach English.<br/>-SHALL &gt; SHOULD.<br/>E.g: She said, &quot;What shall we learn today?&quot;<br/>
      </p><p class="s23">REPORTED SPEECH WITH MODALS AND CONDITIONALS</p><p>She asked what we should learn today.<br/>-MAY &gt; MIGHT.<br/>E.g: She said, &quot;May I open a new browser?&quot; She asked if she might open a new browser.<br/>WOULD, COULD, MIGHT, SHOULD, OUGHT TO &gt; Don´t change.<br/>

Sometimes we use a word that sounds exactly the same as another one, but they differ either in spelling or in meaning. These two phenomena are known as homonyms and homophones. Don’t try to remember these names, just have a look at what they mean and you’ll understand their importance for the correct understanding of a message and also will help you to improve your pronunciation.<br/>A <b>homonym </b>is a word that has the same pronunciation and spelling as another word, but a different meaning. Example: The word “stalk”, meaning either part of a plant or to follow (someone) around.<br/>A <b>homophone </b>is a word that has the same pronunciation as another word, but whose meaning and/or spelling are different. Example: All of “to”, “too”, and “two”, or “there”, “their”, and “they’re”.<br/><span><IMG width="612" height="59" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_267.png"/></span><br/>These can cause ambiguity in reading text or in hearing speech.<br/><span><IMG width="612" height="54" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_268.png"/></span></p><p class="s24">Here are a few examples of HOMOPHONES (but in reality there are many):</p><p>their: belonging to them<br/><span><IMG width="588" height="54" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_269.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="623" height="301" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_270.png"/></span><br/>there: that place (opposed to here); denotes existence of something they&#39;re: contraction for &quot;they are&quot;<br/>This is their home.<br/>They live there…on the Hawaiian beaches.<br/>They’re very happy together!<br/>

Two stresses cannot be one word.)<br/>2.  <b>We can only stress vowels, not consonants.</b><br/>Sometimes the same word can change its stress but this means either that its meaning changes (e.g. the word is either a verb or a noun) or that the person that talks is either American or English (less common).<br/><span><IMG width="588" height="4" src="https://app.oxbridge.es/app/movil/FT/Manual S4/Image_297.png"/></span><br/>Here are some more, rather complicated, rules that can help you understand where to put the stress.

Thus, we can<br/>add <i>un- </i>to <i>happy </i>and we’ll have <b>unhappy</b>, the opposite of happy!<br/>Prefixes can change the root of a word in many ways, and the ones below give you the opposite meaning of the word. For example: Happy---Unhappy (someone who is very sad).<br/>The most common prefixes used to give a negative meaning to adjectives, and some verbs and nouns, are as follows:<br/>1.

By adding the prefix &#39;dis&#39; and the suffix &#39;able&#39; you can make new words such as &#39;discomfort&#39; and &#39;comfortable&#39;.<br/>Adding suffixes to words can change or add to their meaning, but most importantly they show how a word will be used in a sentence and what part of speech (e.g. noun, verb, and adjective) the word belongs to.<br/>There are various suffixes we use.
